# Getting Started

This guide tells you everything you need to know to set up and use a frame quickly. We're going to add more in-depth information on specific topics elsewhere in this documentation over time.

## 1. Create a user account

Go to [openframe.io](https://openframe.io/login) and create a new account.


## 2. Setup a frame

Openframe is designed for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) although it might run on other computers.

**Hardware requirements**

* **Any Raspberry Pi model** w/ power adaptor. [Use of Raspberry Pi 4 is experimental](#requirements).  
It needs to connect to the internet either via ethernet or WiFi. [Check here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Generations_of_released_models) if your model comes with built-in WiFi.
* Monitor that connects to the HDMI port of the Raspberry Pi (others are probably [not going to work](#tft-displays))
* SD card
* Keyboard + Mouse

If you're looking for a Raspberry Pi starter pack, this would work well: [Starter pack](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY)

Head over to the [Hardware section](#hardware) for more info.

<aside class="info">If you already have a Raspberry Pi running and connected to the internet, jump to step <a href="#2-2-install-openframe">2.2 Install Openframe</a>.</aside>


### 2.0 Prepare SD card

Follow the [Raspberry Pi installation guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) and copy the latest version of the Raspian operating system on to the SD card. Alternatively, use a pre-flashed SD-card with [NOOBS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/).

Or you can download an [SD image with Openframe preinstalled](https://gist.github.com/jvolker/96a52b05459316643f8e110ff46b8e32). If you choose this option, set up the hardware (as described below) boot the Pi, log in and jump to step <a href="#2-3-start-the-frame">2.3 Start the frame</a>.

### 2.1 Configure the Pi

1. **Set up hardware:** Insert the SD card, WiFi dongle, and connect the monitor, keyboard and mouse.
2. **Plug in the Pi** Your Pi should boot into Desktop. 
3. **Connect to the internet** if you are not connected via ethernet, click the network icon in the upper right-hand corner, turn on WiFi and select your WiFi network. 
4. **Configure:** Open the Menu (top left corner) > `Preferences` > `Raspberry Pi Configuration`.  
   
<aside class="info">
  <span style="font-weight: bold">Required/Highly recommended settings:</span> 
  <ul>
    <li>
      Increase the GPU memory split. Depending on your Pis available memory, 128MB or 256MB for Pi 1 - 3 and 512MB for Pi 4 with more than 1GB of RAM are propbably good values. Otherwise, the image and shader extension might not work properly. <code>Performance</code> > <code>GPU Memory</code></li>
    <li>
      Boot the Pi to terminal/CLI as Openframe doesn't work from the Desktop. Select <code>System</code> > <code>Boot</code> and select <code>To CLI</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

- Select your timezone in `Localisation` > `Set Timezone`</li>
- *Optional* - Enable SSH: `Interfaces` > `SSH` > `Enabled` 
- *Optional* - Change your password: (the default password is `raspberry`)

<ol start="5">
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Finish</span> Click <code>OK</code> to close the configuration tool <span style="font-weight: bold">and reboot</span>.</li>
  <li>When the Pi reboots, <span style="font-weight: bold">login</span> with the root user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>, unless you changed it.</li>
</ol>

<aside class="info">
  These settings can be edited later in either one of these ways: 
  <ul>
    <li>Through the <code>Raspberry Pi Configuration</code> in desktop</li>
    <li>By running the config tool <code>sudo raspi-config</code> from command line</li>
    <li>By editing the <code>/boot/config.txt</code>. You can <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/">read more on this here</a>.</li>
    </li>
  </ul>
</aside>

### 2.2 Install Openframe

```terminal
$ bash -c "$(curl https://openframe.io/install.sh)"
```

In the command line on the Raspberry Pi, execute the install shell script. The installation takes around 20 minutes (could be longer on a slow connection). Follow the instructions at the end of the installation. 

You need to restart the Pi before the next step.

### 2.3 Start the frame

After installation, just type `openframe` at the command line.

If it's the first time you start the frame, it will ask you for your Openframe username and password, a name for this frame, and if you want to boot into openframe automatically when the Pi starts.

```terminal
$ openframe
? Enter your Openframe username: lewisc
? Enter your Openframe password: ****
? Enter a name for this Frame: Living Room Frame
? Do you want to boot openframe on startup? (Y/n): No

[o]   Connected! You can now push artwork to this frame.

This frame should now appear as Living Room Frame when you log in to Openframe at https://openframe.io.
```

<aside class="info">
  <ul>
    <li>If you haven't selected to autoboot, you can exit Openframe with <code>Ctrl + C</code>, or <code>Ctrl + W</code> in website artworks.</li>
    <li>If you choose to autoboot (the default), holding <code>n</code> during startup of the Pi will bring you to the command line instead of launching Openframe.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

You're now ready to start displaying artwork!

## 3. Displaying artwork

1. [Log in to the Web-App](https://openframe.io/login) using your account.
2. You can find artwork on the [public stream](#public-artwork-stream) or [your personal artwork collection](#your-artwork-collection).
3. Pick something you like and click the **`arrow button`** to push the artwork to your frame.<br>
<br>

The artwork should show up on the frame a few seconds later.

<aside class="warning">
  <span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshooting:</span> 
  <ul>
    <li>Some artwork might require you to install an extension on your Openframe, that might not be installed by default. More on <a href="#artwork-formats-and-extensions">extensions</a>.</li>
    <li>Some artwork might be offline. You might not get any feedback if this happens.</li>
    <li>Some artwork might be very large and it can take a while to download to the frame depending on the internet connection.</li>
