# Artwork

##  Public Artwork stream

The [Stream](https://openframe.io/stream) contains all artwork that users have made **public**. You can **like** artwork from the Stream to save it. Click the like button again to remove it.

## Your Artwork collection

Your artwork collection contains artwork that you've **added**, or you've **liked** from the Stream. You can find it clicking on the **`YOU`** button next to the **`BROWSE`** in the [stream](https://openframe.io/stream).

It's located at this URL: `www.openframe.io/{username}`

## Adding artwork

You can add artwork through the [Openframe web-app](https://openframe.io/stream). 

<aside class="info">
In addition, there is a <a href="https://openframe.discourse.group/t/webclipper/61">Web Clipper extension for Chrome in the making</a>, which is going to make the uploading process a lot easier, in most cases. In the meantime, this guide is hopefully going to be helpful to you.

1. [Create a new account](https://openframe.io/login), if you haven't done already.
2. Then click on **`You`** to navigate to your personal artwork stream (which includes all artwork you have uploaded) and click **`Add artwork`** to add a new piece.

3. Your artwork must have a title.
4. Choose the right artwork format (e.g. `openframe-image`). More on this further below in the [Artwork formats](#artwork-formats) section.
5. Enter the URL to your artwork into the field `URL where the artwork is hosted`. You have to [host the artwork](#hosting-artwork) yourself.
6. Optionally enter a URL to a preview image of the sketch which is useful to quickly identify the artwork in the web-app. This is even more important if you like to publish your beautiful artwork.

<aside class="warning">By <span style="font-weight: bold">making an artwork public</span>, you are claiming to be the author (or copyright holder) of the work — please do not publish works that are not your own. <br><br> More on this in the <a href="#rights">rights section</a>.</aside>

## Hosting artwork

<aside class="info">
  Currently, you have to upload your artwork to a publicly reachable webspace. 
</aside>

**If you don't have a webspace/server?** 

You could, as one out of many options, try Dropbox. Once it's uploaded to Dropbox, use the `Copy Dropbox Link`. You will end up with a URL like this `https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb17ehsdfqp2bjd/290317.jpg?dl=0`. Change the 0 at the end to 1 like this `https://www.dropbox.com/s/vb17ehsdfqp2bjd/290317.jpg?dl=1`, and you will be able to use the URL for Openframe.

## Rights


<aside class="info">
<span style="font-weight: bold">Openframe does not store any artwork.</span> Frames fetch artwork directly form the provided URL each time it's required to display it. Make sure you have the rights to the artwork you add and display using Openframe.
</aside>

The artwork will be available as long as the content in the URL is available.

<aside class="info">
At this stage, there is no way to attach a <span style="font-weight: bold">license / copyright</span> to your artwork. We are aware that this is not ideal. If you have ideas on how to approach this topic, please let us know <a href="https://openframe.discourse.group/c/artwork/11">in the forum</a>.
