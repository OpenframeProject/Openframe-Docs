## What is Openframe?

Openframe is an open source platform for artists, curators and art enthusiasts to share, discover and display digital art.

Openframe is free. Anyone can set up a frame using an HDMI display and a Raspberry Pi.

Openframe is a collaborative, on-going project. The platform consists of an API, a web app, and software for the RPi that currently supports images, video, web-based artwork, and shaders (more on this in the [Platform section](#platform)). Our goal is to create a system that is accessible and extensible, allowing artists to easily add support for new digital formats.

Go to [openframe.io](http://www.openframe.io) for more info.
